    abstract={Affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties with various level structures show up in the study of Shimura varieties and moduli spaces of shtukas. Among is the Iwahori level structure which is the most refined one. We study the nonemptiness problem of single affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties at Iwahori level in the basic case. Under a genericity condition (the ``shrunken Weyl chambers'' condition), an explicit criterion is known. However, no explicit criterion has been available without the condition even conjecturally. We conjecture a new criterion in full generality, and prove it except for finitely many cases. As an application, the nonemptiness problem in some non-basic cases and a new conjectural dimension formula are discussed.},
