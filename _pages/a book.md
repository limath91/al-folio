I have published a book in South Korea. The Korean title is 인생에서 수학머리가 필요한 순간 and the English translation is <b>The Moment in Life when You Need a Math Brain</b>.

It is available in Korean only. You can find it <a href="http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?mallGb=KOR&ejkGb=KOR&barcode=9791158511418">here (교보)</a> or <a href="http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/76655076">here (예스24)</a>.

From September 2015 to August 2018, I did military duty in South Korea. During those 36 months, I served as a researcher in _Education & Culture department_ in National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (NIMS) at Daejeon, South Korea. Main duties were (as the name suggests) study and develop 'math culture' in South Korea.

I delivered 50 lectures all over South Korea with the audience middle or high school students and general public with some interests in math.
