Welcome! I am Dong Gyu Lim. (Dong Gyu is my first name.)

I am on the job market now (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023).<br>
In May 2023, I am expecting to receive my PhD diploma.

The picture is me standing on a huge rock somewhere in Yosemite.

This website is under construction (almost done, hopefully).
If your background is white/black and you prefer a darker/brighter theme, click the crescent/sun icon in the menu.

I love (active and collaborative) sports. I have been playing tennis almost two years now. I love soccer too.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
